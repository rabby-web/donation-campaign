# Donation Campaign

Certainly! Here are three project features you can add to a React-based Donation Campaign application to enhance its functionality and user experience:

- User Profiles and Donation History:
  Implement user profiles where donors can create accounts and manage their donation history. This feature allows donors to keep track of their contributions and easily access their donation receipts.
  Provide a dashboard that displays a summary of a user's donation history, including the total amount donated, the number of campaigns supported, and their favorite causes.
- Real-time Donation Progress Tracking:
  Integrate real-time updates on campaign progress. Show donors how close a campaign is to reaching its goal with a progress bar or visual indicator.
  Use WebSocket or a similar technology to provide instant updates when new donations are made. This can create a sense of urgency and encourage more contributions.
- Social Sharing and Fundraising Teams:
  Enable users to create fundraising teams or join existing ones. Each team can have its own donation campaign with a shared goal.
  Incorporate social sharing features to allow donors to easily share campaigns on popular social media platforms. This can help campaigns reach a wider audience and attract more donors.
